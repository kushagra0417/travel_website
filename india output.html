<a name="wonder1"><center><b>Day 1: Arrive in New Delhi</b></center>
  After you reach the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, by morning, drive right away to your hotel.
  There are countless budget to luxury hotels near New Delhi airport and hence even if you have not booked in advance…
  you can go for current booking. Try out butter chicken with butter Naan and Lassi at lunch if you want to wake up your carnivore nature straight away on day one.
  But if you want to stick to some veg menu, then go for sahi paneer and butter naan with falooda, one of the popular local beverages of India. Burp! And then you head for Akshardham Temple,
  which is the largest Hindu temple in the world that displays millennia of traditional Hindu and Indian culture, spirituality, and architecture. Stay back at Akshardham to experience the musical fountain show and thereafter drive back to your hotel.
  If you are not looking for a posh wine and dine… then go for Murgh Musallam and have some chapatti. Burp! Goodnight.

  Overnight at the hotel
