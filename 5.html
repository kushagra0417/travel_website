<div class="a"><h3>Uttarakhand Travel Guide to Plan a Best Trip</h3></div>
Uttarakhand formerly known as Uttaranchal, and often referred to as the Dev
Bhumi- the Land of Gods, owing to numerous pilgrimage centres and Hindu
temples throughout the state.
<div class="b"><h3>BEST TIME TO VISIT UTTARAKHAND:</h3></div>
March to April and September to October are considered as the best time to
visit Uttarakhand. The state has wonderful weather all through the year.
Trekking, Paragliding and The Char Dham Yatra are the most popular
activities during Summer, which is also the Peak Season in Uttarakhand.
<div class="c"><h3>WHY VIST UTTARKHAND?:</h3></div>
There is an amazing valley full of flowers.
And you can't miss Jim Corbett National Park.
There is a lake with mountains on both sides through which you can take a boat ride.
And a river with a bridge that can take you back in time.
