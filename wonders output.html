<p>The <b>Taj Mahal,</b>'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the<br>
southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (reigned<br>
from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himslef. The tomb is<br>

on three sides by a crenellated</p>
<p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the projects for another 10<br>
years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been complete its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around<br>
32 million rupees, which in 2020 should be aproximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction employed<br>
some 20,000 artisans under a guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahamad Lahauri.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal was designed as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the<br>
universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a<br>
symbol of Indian rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year and in 2007, <b>it was declared as a winner of the new 7<br>
Wonders of the World</b> (2000-2007) initiative.</p>

<p><b>Chinchen Itza</b> was a large preColombian city built by Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The<br>
archaeological site is located in Tinum Municipality, Yucatan state, Mexico</p>
<p>Chenchen Itza was a major focal point in the Northen Maya Lowlands from the Late classic (c.AD 600-900) through<br>
the Terminal Classis (c.AD 800-900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c.AD 900-1200). The site<br>
exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, remeniscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes<br>
styles of the Northen Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexcian styles wad once thought to have been<br>
representative of direct migration or even consequent from central Mexico, but most contemperory interpretations view<br>
the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural deffusion.</p>
<p>Chinchen Itza was one of the largest maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or<br>
Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse populatin in the Maya<br>
world, The factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p>
<p>The ruins of the Chenchen Itza are fedral property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexcios Instituto Nacional<br>
de Antropologia e Historia (National Institute of Antropology and History). The land under the monument had been<br>
privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatan.<br>
Chinchen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexcio with over 2.6 million tourests in 2017.</p>

<p><b>Petra</b>(romanized:Al-Batra, Ancient Greek:"Stone"), originally known to it's inhabitants in Nabataean Amaraic as<br>
rqmw Raqemo, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Petra lies around Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin<br>
surrounded by the mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gluf of Aqaba. The<br>
area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataean might have sattled in what would become the<br>
capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. However archaeological work has only discovered avidence of<br>
Nabataean presence dating back to the second centuary BC, by wich time Ptera had become their capital. The Nabataeans were<br>
nomadic Arabs who invested the Ptera's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.</p>
<p>The trading bussiness gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra become the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were<br>
accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks by taking advantages of the area's<br>
mountainous terrain. They were perticularly skilful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra florished in the 1st<br>
centuary AD, when it's famous Al-Khazneh structure-belived to be the mausoleum of the Nabataean king Aritas IV- was constructed,<br>
and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants</p>

<a name="wonder6"><center><b>Tour to The Great Wall of China</b></center>
<p><b>The Great Wall of China</b>(pinyin:Wanli Changcheng) is the collective<br>
name of a series of fortifaction system generally built across the historical northern borders of China to protect and consolidate<br>
territories of Chinese states and empires against various nomadic groups of the steppe and their polities. Several walls were being built<br>
from as early as the 7th centuary BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220-<br>
206 BC), the first emporer of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained<br>
multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).</p>
<p>Apart from defence, other purpose of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties of goods<br>
transported along the Silk Road, regulation of encouragement of trade and the control of the immigration and emigration. Furthermore,<br>
the defencive characterictics of The Great  Wall were inhanced by the construction o watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations,<br>
singaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation<br>
corridor</p>
<p>The frontire wall built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they strech from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in<br>
the west, from the present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Tao River(Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delaneates<br>
the edge of the Mongolian steppe. A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced techonologies, has concluded that the walls<br>
built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi). This is made up of 6,259 km(3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km<br>
(223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km(1,387 mi) of natural defencive barriers such as hills and rivers. Another archaeological survey<br>
found that the entire wall with all of its branches measures out to be 21,196 km(13.171 mi). Today, the defensive system of the Great<br>
Wall is generally rechonised as one of the most impressive architectural feast in history.</p>
